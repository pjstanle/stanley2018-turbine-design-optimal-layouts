# Optimal Wind Turbine Layouts
> These figures show the optimal wind turbine layouts associated with the paper "Coupled Wind Turbine Design and Layout Optimization with Non-Homogeneous Wind Turbines." The color schemes in these figures match the colors from figures 9-14 in the paper, meaning: the figures with the white dots represent the turbine layout optimizations, the gray dots show the sequential turbine design then layout optimization, the black dots show the couple turbine design and layout optimization, and the purple and pink dots show the coupled turbine design then layout optimization with two different turbine groups. The purple dots show turbine group 1, the smaller rotor diameters, while the pink dots show turbine group 2, the bigger rotor diameters.
